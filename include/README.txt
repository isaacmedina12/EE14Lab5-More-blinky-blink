1. I now understand how prescalars, ARRs, and CCRs work (for the most part). I 
   learned how to compute the right prescalar and ARR value, as well as the 
   restaints that these values have. For example, the ARR is a 16-bit value on the 
   microcontroller. I also learned how to rigoursly analyze code so that I understand it.
   This was important in this lab, for documentation and finishing the lab. After realizing that
   I was calculating a minimum prescalar to get the ARR and then the CCR, the lab went 
   smoothly. I learned how to use git for this lab. I also now understand how important
   bit widths and sign matter a lot.

2. One thing I am still a bit confused about is why when I initially did this lab I was 
   not able to get a high frequency to work. It worked very well for <65Hz, but then did
   not work above that frequency. I realized that this was because of the prescalar being a
   16-bit unsigned and rolling over at higher frequencies with the formula I had. I was confused
   on why Prof. Bell had me drop the -1 in the formula, but when I understood the unsigned part, 
   it made more sense because the value was rolling over from a very small fraction to the max 
   value because they are unsigned.

3. I spent 2 hours in lab, plus like 8 additional hours on my own finishing completing.
   So ~10 hours.
